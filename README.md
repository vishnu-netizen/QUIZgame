# 🎯 QUIZgame

A simple **Java console-based Quiz Game** that asks the user multiple-choice questions, takes input from the keyboard, and displays the final score.

## 📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Java such as **classes, objects, arrays, and methods**.

It contains:
- A `question` class — to store question text, options, and the correct answer.
- A `questionService` class — to manage the list of questions, display them, and calculate the score.
- A `Main` class — the entry point that runs the game.
